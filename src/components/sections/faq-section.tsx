const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What can you build in GoHighLevel?",
    a: "CRM setup, pipelines, workflows, automated follow-up, appointment journeys, landing pages and conversations — all organized in one platform so every lead has a clear path.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build a complete lead-to-booking system?",
    a: "Yes. A complete system connects Meta Ads, a landing page, lead capture, a GoHighLevel CRM pipeline, automation and follow-up — so a lead moves from first click to booked appointment without manual gaps.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you work with an existing GoHighLevel account?",
    a: "Yes. I can audit, restructure and build on an existing account — fixing pipelines, workflows and follow-up, or extending it with new automation and lead capture.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Meta Ads be connected with GoHighLevel?",
    a: "Yes — that's the core of the system. Meta Ads generate the leads; GoHighLevel receives and manages them. Leads flow from ad campaigns into the CRM, where automation handles follow-up and pipeline movement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What type of businesses do you work with?",
    a: "Lead-based local businesses — dental clinics, salons, real estate, accounting and finance, and other service businesses that need a clear lead journey from ad to customer.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I get started?",
    a: "Send a message on WhatsApp. Tell me about your business, your current lead flow and what you'd like to improve, and I'll outline how a connected system would work for you.",
  },
