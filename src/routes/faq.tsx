    q: "What is GoHighLevel?",
    a: "GoHighLevel is an all-in-one platform that combines CRM, pipelines, workflows, follow-up automation, landing pages and conversations into a single system — so leads are captured, organized and followed up in one place.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does GoHighLevel help businesses?",
    a: "It connects every part of the lead journey — capture, CRM, pipeline, follow-up and appointments — into one platform. Instead of leads scattered across tools, every lead has a clear, organized path from first contact to customer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What can you automate?",
    a: "The work that happens after the lead: instant follow-up, qualification, reminders, pipeline updates and team notifications. Automation reduces manual gaps and keeps the customer journey moving consistently.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you run Meta Ads?",
    a: "Yes. I build Meta Ads campaigns from strategy to optimization — campaign structure, audience research, creative direction, lead generation and retargeting — connected directly to the CRM so leads flow into one system.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build landing pages?",
    a: "Yes. I build conversion-focused landing pages designed to turn ad attention into captured leads, then connect them straight into the CRM and automation workflow.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you connect ads with CRM?",
    a: "Yes — that's the core of the system. Meta Ads generate the leads; GoHighLevel receives and manages them. Leads from ad campaigns flow into the CRM, where automation handles follow-up, pipeline movement and reminders.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build a complete lead-generation system?",
    a: "Yes. A complete system includes Meta Ads, a landing page, lead capture, a GoHighLevel CRM pipeline, automation and follow-up — all connected so every lead has a defined journey from click to customer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the projects on this website real client projects?",
    a: "These are concept projects created to demonstrate how I design marketing and automation systems. Real client case studies will be added as projects are completed — without fabricated results.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I contact you?",
    a: "The primary contact method is WhatsApp. Use any WhatsApp button on the site to start a conversation about your business, lead generation and automation requirements.",
  },
